# The while loop represents the game.
# Each iteration represents a turn of the game
# where you are given inputs (the heights of the mountains)
# and where you have to print an output (the index of the mountain to fire on)
# The inputs you are given are automatically updated according to your last actions.


# game loop
while True:
    maxh = 0
    maxi = 0 
    for i in range(8):
        mountain_h = int(input()) 
        if mountain_h > maxh:
            maxh = mountain_h 
            maxi = i 
            if maxh < mountain_h:
                continue 
    print(maxi)
